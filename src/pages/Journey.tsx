                My story begins in <strong>Dehkora</strong>, a small village where the values of hard work,
                integrity, and community were not just taught but lived every day. Growing up in a close-knit
                environment, I witnessed the power of collective action and the importance of giving back.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My mother, <strong>Bala Devi Ruhil</strong>, was my first teacher and greatest inspiration.
                Despite limited resources, she instilled in me an unwavering belief in education and the
                power of determination. My grandparents taught me the value of patience, wisdom, and the
                importance of maintaining one's roots while reaching for the sky.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                These early experiences in Dehkora shaped my worldview and became the foundation for my
                leadership philosophy. The lessons learned in that village—about community, resilience,
                and purpose—continue to guide every decision I make today.

                Education was my gateway to opportunity. From an early age, I was fascinated by how
                things worked—from mechanical devices to complex systems. This curiosity led me to
                pursue engineering, where I discovered my passion for technology and innovation.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My academic journey was marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge. I didn't just want
                to understand the "how" but also the "why." This approach to learning—questioning,
                exploring, and connecting dots—became a hallmark of my professional career.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Beyond formal education, I embraced every opportunity to learn from experiences, mentors,
                and even failures. This lifelong commitment to learning has been instrumental in adapting
                to changing landscapes and staying ahead in the fast-paced world of technology.

                My professional journey began at <strong>IBM</strong>, where I joined as a software engineer.
                This wasn't just my first job—it was my entry into a world of endless possibilities. At IBM,
                I worked on cutting-edge projects that challenged me to think beyond conventional solutions.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The early years at IBM taught me discipline, the importance of systematic thinking, and
                the value of collaboration. I learned to work with diverse teams, navigate complex technical
                challenges, and understand how technology could transform businesses and lives.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                More importantly, IBM showed me that technology leadership isn't just about technical
                expertise—it's about vision, empathy, and the ability to inspire others. These lessons
                became the bedrock of my leadership approach as I progressed in my career.
